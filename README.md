# Betting-cplusplus

I found the betting project written in **C++** interesting from [this site](https://hackr.io). I've had some ideas to change it.
The final result is as demonstrated.
some of changes are:
  1. Instead of one number gussing, two numbers are guessed and if each or sum of them are correct, you will win.
  2. When the balance of user if finished instead of exiting without any message, first the user is informed and then exit() functions.
