# Betting-cplusplus

I found the betting project written in **C++** interesting from [this site](https://hackr.io). I've had some ideas to change it.
The final result is as demonstrated.
some of changes are:
  1. Instead of one number gussing, two numbers are guessed and if each or sum of them are correct, you will win.
  2. When your balance is finished instead of exiting without leaving any message, first you are informed and then exit() functions.
